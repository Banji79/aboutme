   <h1 style="text-align: center;background-color: black; color: white;"  id="about">ABOUT ME</h1>
   <p>My name is Banji Oluwatoyosi Victor. I was born on the 9th of January. I was born in Jos, Plateau State. I lived my early life there before moving to Osogbo in 2015. I attended <u>St Paul's Anglican Private School</u> for my primary school education and <u>Roseful International High School</u> for my secondary school education. I was in the science department due to my early interest in medical sciences.I am a fan of Chelsea Football Club which is one of the biggest and best teams in the world. I love to watch football and movies. I also love listening to music. I am over 6 feet tall. My favourite food is fried rice and the reason I like it is because I don't eat it often.</p>   
    <p> I am currently learning web development at OIC Hub, Orita-Sabo. Hopefully, my time here will not be a waste. I pray that this period will be profitable to me in the near future. I hope this web development will come easy to me and I will not dissapoint myself.If all goes well, I plan to use my skills profitably, perhaps I can even bring other people into web development as my brother has. Hopefully, I will be much faster at typing at the end of my time because I don't want to spend more time than necessary while writing code. I also wish that I will be able to write code with very little or no mistake. My first day learning web development, specifically frontend development was relatively smooth. As I continue to learn, I reckon it will become easier to me. I doubt that I'll go into full time web development after this but i guess I'll see what happens.</p>
